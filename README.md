# Creating Vector Tiles from Ordnance Survey Opendata

This repository contains the presentation materials, samples and code for talk given by Dave Barter at the [FOSS4G 2018](http://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2018/) Open Source conference.

[create_tiles](create_tiles) contains the **make_vector_tiles.pl** script which provides a wrapper around the workflow necessary to create MVT format vector tiles from multiple shape files. This requires a config file **config.json**
